  <p class= "five-text1"> THE SILENT ERA </p>

  <p class="five-text"> Spanning over three decades from the 1890s to the 1920s, the silent era was the start of cinema. Over that time period, movies evolved from a novelty to an art form. In addition, silent films also became a big business in this era. Silent movies provided cheap entertainment that overcame the language barrier for the millions of immigrants coming to America in the early 20th century.</p>

   <p class="five-text2"> The most well known actor at this time was Charlie Chaplin. An accomplished vaudeville performer, Chaplin made his first film in 1914 and later that year created his signature character, The Tramp. While usually remembered for his work in front of the camera, Charlie Chaplin’s contributions to film go beyond his performances as a comedic actor. He also worked as director, cinematographer, and even a composer, Chaplin made crucial contributions to the developing art of silent film.</p>

  <h1>Talkies</h1>

  <p class="six-text1">1930s</p>

  <p class="six-text"> Talkies get their name from the recorded dialogue that played in sync with the images on screen. Before films relied on intertitle text to explain key plot points and live pianists, organists, and orchestras to provide score and sound in the theater. As technology advanced, recorded dialogue made its way into film and “talking pictures” were born. Talkies changed the way films were produced and distributed. Since most theaters in the 1920s used live orchestras and not projected sound, they didn’t have the equipment needed to play sound films. Due to the box office success of early talkies, theaters began the expensive process of wiring for sound and by 1930 around 10,000 of the estimated 15,000 cinemas in the United States had been retrofitted with the necessary technology.</p>
