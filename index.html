   <p class= "three-text1"> THE FIRST MOTION PICTURE</p>

  <p class="three-text"> Eadweard Muybridge sucessfully captured motion images of a horse galloping. This was done by placing 12 cameras with electromagnetic shutters along the a track and a thread was used to activated them.The series became the first example of chronophotography, an early method to photographically record the passing of time, mainly used to document the different phases of locomotion for scientific study. It formed an important step in the development of motion pictures for years to come. </p>

  <p class= "five-text1"> THE SILENT ERA </p>

  <p class="five-text"> Spanning over three decades from the 1890s to the 1920s, the silent era was the start of cinema. Over that time period, movies evolved from a novelty to an art form. In addition, silent films also became a big business in this era. Silent movies provided cheap entertainment that overcame the language barrier for the millions of immigrants coming to America in the early 20th century.</p>

   <p class="five-text2"> The most well known actor at this time was Charlie Chaplin. An accomplished vaudeville performer, Chaplin made his first film in 1914 and later that year created his signature character, The Tramp. While usually remembered for his work in front of the camera, Charlie Chaplin’s contributions to film go beyond his performances as a comedic actor. He also worked as director, cinematographer, and even a composer, Chaplin made crucial contributions to the developing art of silent film.</p>

  <h1>Talkies</h1>

  <p class="six-text1">1930s</p>

  <p class="six-text2">Introducing Sound</p>

   <p class="six-text"> Talkies get their name from the recorded dialogue that played in sync with the images on screen. Before films relied on intertitle text to explain key plot points and live pianists, organists, and orchestras to provide score and sound in the theater. As technology advanced, recorded dialogue made its way into film and “talking pictures” were born. Talkies changed the way films were produced and distributed. Since most theaters in the 1920s used live orchestras and not projected sound, they didn’t have the equipment needed to play sound films. Due to the box office success of early talkies, theaters began the expensive process of wiring for sound and by 1930 around 10,000 of the estimated 15,000 cinemas in the United States had been retrofitted with the necessary technology.</p>

  <h1>Film in Technicolour</h1>

  <h1>1940s<h1>
    <p class="nine-text1">Introducing Colour</p>
    <p class="nine-text2"> Technicolor is a series of processes used to first produce color in motion pictures. From 1916 to 1932, the Technicolor company tinkered with its system so that the process of coloring films became accessible to Hollywood. Today, Technicolor is perhaps more known for the end result of the coloring process than the process itself. Technicolor films are known for their bright, bold, saturated colors. It took a long time for Technicolor to settle on the best process for getting the full spectrum of color in its pictures. One reason for this is that the company was using a two color system in their cameras which only produced one strip of negatives.</p>

    <p class="nine-text3"> Shooting in Technicolor also required absurd amounts of light, often coming in the form of giant bulbs that propelled set temperatures to over 100 degrees. So when Eastman Kodak came along in the 1950s and released a 35mm color film stock that could capture color on a single reel, the ease of use and reduction in price quickly trumped any quality loss.</p>

  <h1></h1>

    <p class="eleven-text"> In the period following World War II, when most of the films were idealized with conventional portrayals of men and women, young people wanted new and exciting symbols of rebellion. Hollywood responded to audience demands - the early 1950s saw the rise of the anti-hero - with stars like newcomers James Dean, Paul Newman and Marlon Brando. Anti-heroines included Ava Gardner, Kim Novak, and Marilyn Monroe. It was also the rise of new experimentation with the movie theatre experience.</p>

  <h1>3D</h1>

  <p class="twelve-text">3D Films</p>

     <p class="twelve-text1"> A 3-D film is a motion picture that uses various technologies as a means to enhance the illusion of depth perception. A special motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives (in modern days, computers generate the two perspectives). To view the 3D images, special eyewear is worn to provide the illusion of depth when viewing the movie. Although previously Edwin S. Porter and William E. Waddell presented the first 3D test movie to audiences 1915, and first explorations date back way before then, the Golden Era of 3D began in the 1950s. To counter TV, Hollywood looked for gimmicks to attract moviegoers thus came the 3D experience back into cinemas, with the release of the first color 3D movie, Bwana Devil</p>

  <h1>Going Bigger</h1>

<div class= 'fourteen'>
  <h1>Aspect Ratio</h1> 

  <p class="fourteen-text"> Cinerama </p>



  <p class="fourteen-text1"> In 1952, the Cinerama process, using three projectors and a wide, deeply curved screen together with multi-track surround sound, was premiered. It had a very large aspect ratio of 2.59:1, giving audiences a greater sense of immersion, and proved extremely popular. Cinerama was the first of a number of new cinema processes introduced during the 1950s, when the film industry found itself competing against television.</p>

  <p class="fourteen-text2"> However, widescreen cinema was not widely adopted by the industry because it was complex, expensive, and required specialised equipment. The invention of CinemaScope in 1953 and Todd‑AO in 1955 allowed for a cheaper and easier option. CinemaScope  ‘squeezed’ images on 35mm film; when projected, they were expanded laterally by the projector lens to fit the screen. Todd-AO used film with a width of 70mm. By the end of the 1950s, these innovations had effectively changed the shape of the cinema screen, with aspect ratios of either 2.35:1 or 1.66:1 becoming standard. Stereo sound, which had been experimented with in the 1940s, also became part of the new widescreen experience. After only 10 years, Cinerama fell out of use but opened new oppurtunities for changing the aspect ratio as screens got bigger, and technology advanced towards IMAX in the 1970s. </p>

<div class= 'sixteen'>
  <h1></h1>
  <p class="sixteen-text1"> New Hollywood is a film movement that took place in the United States from roughly 1967-1976. The movement was lead by a group of film students with a passion for filmmaking and the desire to challenge the stagnant status quo. Also known as the Hollywood New Wave, these filmmakers often worked within the Studio System but brought an independent and radical perspective to mainstream filmmaking. Their bold subject matter are largely credited with ending the Hays code, and opening the floodgates of creativity in Hollywood. </p>

  <p class= "eighteen-text"> Digital Cameras</p>

  <p class="eighteen-text1"> By 1999, movies had gone digital. George Lucas’s Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace introduced the seamless integration of digitally shot camerawork. By Episode 2, Attack of the Clones, Lucas had gone primarily digital.The digital movie camera era would have two profound effects on movies. It would become cheaper and more reliable to create CGI—computer-generated images—which brought blockbuster special effects to more movies and television shows. It would also make it easier to distribute movies digitally. </p>
